			Was talking in lab to Nobie about how we would read-out the 90TB/sec of data from recording voltage in every neuron in the human brain. We weren't sure whether it would be best to go an optical route.

			I have also been wondering about the actual analysis of the data and how that would be dealt with in terms of time. It is well known in electron microscopy that it is not the data collection where time is lost, but the insane amount of time it takes to analyze the data. Knowing that Google has to deal with analyzing massive amounts of data on a daily basis&mdash;and due in part to methods like MapReduce&mdash;i asked Tom how Google deals with this data deluge.
