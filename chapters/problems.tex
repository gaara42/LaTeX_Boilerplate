	If there is any confusion about the questions, shoot me an email or talk to me after class.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Look at \figcite{wk7:thermal_regulation}{}, why is the heart rate of the iguana different at the same temperature?
			\answers{In the first case the body temperature is decreasing while in the second case the iguana raises its heart rate to increase blood flow, which leads to increased body temperature.}
		\item How does increasing heart rate while in direct sunlight help warm the body?
			\answers{More blood can flow to the skin and be warmed.}
		\item What does it mean for the Q10 of the metabolic rate of an animal to be 2? To be 1?
			\answers{the animal consumes half as much oxygen per hour at 20C as it does at 30C. In the case of 1, it doesn't change.}
